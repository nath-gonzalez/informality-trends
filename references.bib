	abstract = {Using administrative data, we document that workers acquire more human capital at more productive firms. Recessions distort workers-firm sorting, flatten the job ladder and impact human capital accumulation, as workers match on average to worse firms. To quantify the aggregate relevance of these effects, we build a directed search model with aggregate risk and worker-firm heterogeneity, in which human capital accumulation depends on firm quality. We estimate the model and show that recessions have persistent negative effects on the productivity of worker-firm matches, with distortions in sorting and human capital accumulation accounting for approximately 30\% of cumulative output losses.},

I establish a new set of stylized facts, which show that the income tax exemption threshold decreases in the income distribution as a country develops, tracking growth in the employee share of employment that occurs gradually further down the income distribution. Additional evidence supports the interpretation that the rise in third-party covered income through increases in employee share drives expansions of the income tax base over development.

	title = {Business {Income} {Underreporting} and {Public} {Finance}},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a new dynamic theory of business taxation that takes into account income underreporting by owners and potential reputational losses if tax evasion is discovered. Taxpayers are assumed to be of two types: those that are always compliant regardless of opportunity and those that cheat if it is economically beneﬁcial to do so. Opportunities arise in self-employment but, in equilibrium, only for business owners that can weather the costs of an audit, which include ﬁnes for past taxes owed and losses in business brand. The theory is used to predict the aggregate and distributional impacts of increased enforcement eﬀorts and then to run policy counterfactuals. In order to assess quantitative impacts, a baseline model is parameterized to be in line with data from the U.S. national accounts and National Research Program (NRP) random audits. The main policy experiments compare the impacts of increased public spending ﬁnanced either by increased taxation on business incomes or increased enforcement eﬀorts aimed at their owners. Higher enforcement leads to a larger declines in entrepreneurship, less investment in business and ﬁnancial assets, and lower average business ages. However, changes in business incomes are roughly equal in the two experiments because of selection: higher enforcement drives out owners that are unproductive.},

The focus is on the role of informal sector as a stepping stone to formal jobs. I argue that the stepping-stone role of informal jobs is an important concept determining how strongly government policies affect the size of informal sector. I measure the extent of the stepping-stone role with the intensity of skill accumulation in the informal sector. If informal jobs help workers acquire skills, gain expertise, and build professional networks for boosting the chances to switch to a formal job, then the size of informal sector is less sensitive to government policy. In this case, the option value of a job in informal sector will be high and a worker with an informal job will not rush to switch to a formal job when a policy encouraging formal employment is in effect. If, on the other hand, informal sector does not provide satisfactory training opportunities, then the size of informal sector becomes more sensitive to government policy. Calibrating the model to the Brazilian data, I perform numerical exercises confirming that the effect of government policy on the size of informal sector is a decreasing function of the intensity of skill acquisition in the informal sector.},

	abstract = {Labor informality accounts for nearly 40\% of the labor force in Latin America. While a more traditional view sees this phenomenon as a consequence of barriers to mobility resulting from poorly designed labor regulations, recent work provides evidence that individuals choose informal jobs based on their comparative advantage. In this paper, I develop a dynamic life-cycle model estimated with rich Chilean longitudinal data, in which individuals jointly decide on their schooling and labor participation, to investigate the extent to which comparative advantage drives participation in informal labor markets. I find that human capital accumulation and preferences for job amenities explain up to 72\% of transitions between the informal and the formal sector while labor market segmentation accounts for 28\%. These barriers to mobility are decreasing in education. These results are largely driven by heterogeneous preferences and returns to skills across sectors. For example, more educated individuals assign a higher relative importance to non-wage benefits, particularly in formal jobs, while less educated individuals value more monetary rewards; high ability workers are more productive in the formal sector, while low ability workers are more productive in the informal sector; and unlike labor market experience acquired in informal activities, experience acquired in formal jobs is transferable across sectors. Finally, using the model to simulate the effects of a 20\% wage subsidy in formal jobs for young workers, I find that individuals react to labor market expectations and their decisions are persistent. The subsidy would decrease the incentives to informality for both targeted groups and younger workers, while the reduction in informality rates as a consequence of the policy would remain persistent for all the life-cycle.},

The purpose of this paper is to begin to unravel entrepreneurs’ rationales for trading in the informal economy in order to consider what policy measures need to be adopted to facilitate their formalisation. Design/methodology/approach To do this, the results of an empirical survey are reported conducted in Ukraine during 2006/2007 with 331 individuals who had started-up or owned/managed an enterprise. Findings Revealing that the rationales for entrepreneurs operating in the informal economy markedly differ according to whether they are wholly or partially informal entrepreneurs operating temporarily or permanently in the informal economy, the result is a call for a move beyond a “one-size-fits-all” policy approach and towards a variegated public policy approach whereby policy measures are tailored to tackling the different types of informal entrepreneurship, each of which operate informally for varying reasons. Research limitations/implications No evidence yet exists of whether the rationales for engaging in each type of informal entrepreneurship, and the consequent policy measures that need to be used to formalise each type, are more widely valid. Further research to evaluate this is required. Originality/value This is the first paper to start to move beyond a “one size fits all” policy approach when considering how to facilitate the formalisation of entrepreneurs in the informal economy.},

Focusing on the nonmarket strategy approaches entrepreneurs employ to establish relationships with government officials, we build a model that shows how entrepreneurs adopt strategies aligned with their firm’s level of formality, spanning low to high formality practices. We draw on qualitative interview data from entrepreneurs who exhibit varying levels of compliance with state-provided rules and guidelines. We inductively theorize that deciding the firms’ level of formality involves strategic interaction approaches with government officials responsible for rule enforcement. Our findings highlight that the interaction strategies entrepreneurs use hinge on the political capital they possess, eliciting the desired response from government officials, and dissuading the officials from enforcing formal rules or imposing sanctions for informality. We offer theoretical and policy implications for future work on the nuances of firm formality and the interaction between entrepreneurs and government officials.},

	title = {Labor market informality, risk, and public insurance},
	abstract = {A large proportion of workers in developing countries are informal and are not covered by social insurance programs, including pensions and unemployment insurance (UI), depriving them of a key mechanism for mitigating risks. To address this important social issue, governments oﬀer noncontributory beneﬁts, such as minimum pensions. The design of these programs has implications for employment choices and savings, which can be used for self-insurance. To understand how policy can aﬀect these life cycle choices, I develop a life cycle model of formal and informal employment as well as savings and self-employment (which requires self-funded irreversible investment). Formal employment gives access to a bundle of public insurance programs, while informal workers are covered by basic pension guarantees. I estimate the parameters of the model using longitudinal survey data linked with administrative data from Chile and exploiting policy reforms to the pension system. The estimates suggest that the role of savings as self-insurance, the presence of borrowing constraints, and job amenities are important drivers of employment decisions. I also show evidence of complementarities between pensions and UI: when individuals have access to UI to insure themselves in the short run, they are more likely to invest in pensions. In counterfactual simulations, I show how the pension design aﬀects formality decisions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we use a novel approach to decompose diﬀerences in the self-employment probabilities of various socio-economic groups into diﬀerences in their entry rates into self-employment and exit rates from self-employment. This decomposition is based on the estimated Markov transition probabilities into and out of three employment states: non-employment, wage/salary employment, and self-employment. The analysis utilizes data from the March supplement of the Current Population Survey. We concentrate on diﬀerences in self-employment rates due to gender, race, and educational attainment. We demonstrate that the eﬀect of diﬀerential entry rates (relative to the eﬀect of diﬀerential exit rates) varies both across groups and over the life-cycle. The empirical ﬁndings are consistent with some models of self-employment but not with others. In particular, gender diﬀerences in the incidence of self-employment are due to higher female exit rates and are more consistent with conscious career choice rather than with barriers to entry into self-employment. Race diﬀerences in self-employment are due to a black-white gap both in entry and exit rates. However, the entry rate gap becomes progressively smaller over the life-cycle, possibly because African-Americans are able to relax liquidity constraints through life-time savings. Finally, differences in the self-employment rates of college and high school educated individuals appear at mid-life and are due exclusively to diﬀerences in entry rates. This is consistent with the human capital accumulation hypothesis which postulates that the opportunities for self-employment of educated individuals are enhanced by their experience in the salary sector.},

	url = {https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities/Publications/Working-Papers},
	abstract = {This paper examines the implicit subsidies within pension systems across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. We first calculate the theoretical benefits of pension for hypothetical workers in 25 countries in LAC. We show that, on average, LAC's pension systems are subsidized, as they provide pensions above what workers would have obtained by investing pension contributions in a safe asset. Similarly, pension systems are designed to be progressive by offering higher replacement rates (pensions relative to earnings) for low-income workers. Despite this progressivity, in some countries, absolute subsidies could be higher for high-income workers. This occurs because the cost of one percentage point of the replacement increases with the average pension. Second, using data from social protection surveys, we estimate the incidence of pension systems in five LAC countries. We show that, on average, all five systems provide important subsidies to those workers who obtain a pension. However, given the high levels of informal work, in some countries, those subsidies are highly concentrated among high-income workers. Variation is large across countries. The three highest labor income deciles concentrate 70-95\% of all subsidies in defined benefit systems such as Paraguay and Colombia. In defined contribution systems, subsidies are much more progressive, but still, because low-income workers do not qualify for minimum pensions, between 50-60\% of subsidies concentrate in the high-income deciles. Countries like Chile, with explicit subsidies targeted at the bottom of the income distribution, obtain a more progressive distribution of subsidies. Because of relatively low participation rates, women have a weaker link with the pension system. They are also less likely to benefit from implicit subsidies. Finally, we show that non-contributory pensions, if well-targeted, largely improve the redistributive properties of pension systems in LAC.},

This paper contributes to this discussion by analyzing the main patterns and characteristics of those who transition from formal to informal sector jobs and the effects of these movements on relative earnings by examining data from household surveys for Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. The main findings suggest that the composition of the flows of those moving to informal self-employment is more compatible with the exclusionary perspective, while those transitioning to become informal employers tend to have a profile similar to those who remain in the formal sector, aligning with the voluntary view. The behaviour of earnings also supports the heterogeneity view: those becoming self-employed workers experienced a relative loss of income, while those moving to a position as an employer generally experienced a relative increase, in comparison to those who remained in the formal sector.},

We build a new data set consisting of harmonized microdata from rotating panel labor force surveys covering 80 million people from 49 countries. Labor market flows, such as the job-finding or employment exit rate, are higher in developing economies. These higher flows largely reflect a slippery job ladder: workers transition frequently to and from marginal employment without climbing to or persisting in better-paying jobs. Subsistence self-employment and different patterns of selection for wage workers each play a role in our findings and are useful avenues for future theories of labor market frictions.},

The sample-wide impact is driven by increased employment in higher-skill occupations, but less-educated workers’ employment gain less so. Firm-level data available for some countries indicate that increased firm entry, productivity, and exporting contribute to higher net job creation. Average incomes rise.

We ﬁnd that becoming a mother implies a sharp decline in employment, working hours, and labor earnings, while fathers’ outcomes remain unaﬀected. Importantly, the birth of the ﬁrst child also produces a strong increase in labor informality among working mothers (38\%). All these impacts are milder for highly educated women. We assess mechanisms behind these eﬀects based on a model economy and ﬁnd that: (i) informal jobs’ ﬂexible working hours prevent some women from leaving the labor market upon motherhood, (ii) improving the quality of social protection of formal jobs tempers this increase in informality. Our results suggest that mothers ﬁnd in informal jobs the ﬂexibility needed for family-work balance, although it comes at the cost of deteriorating their labor market prospects.},

Recent research emerging from close collaboration of academics with tax authorities has shed new light on how states can build such tax capacity. Using both randomized and natural experiments, these partnerships have not only opened access to new types of data but have also stimulated new perspectives and research questions. While much of research in public finance has historically assumed that a tax in the law is a tax that is collected, exciting new research takes an empirical look inside the black box of tax administration. It addresses issues ranging from the role of information and digitalization to taxpayer behavior or to the link between taxation and citizens’ relationship to the state.

	abstract = {Informality is widespread in most developing countries. In Latin America, 50\% of salaried employees work informally. Three stylized facts characterize informality: (1) small firms tend to operate informally while large firms tend to operate formally; (2) unskilled workers tend to be informal while skilled ones have formal jobs; (3) ceteris paribus, secondary workers (a worker other than the household head) are less likely to operate formally than primary workers. We develop a model that accounts for all these facts. In our model, both heterogeneous firms and workers have preferences over the sector they operate and choose optimally whether to function formally or informally. There are two labor markets, one formal and the other informal, and both firms and workers act unconstrained in them. By contrast, a prominent feature of the preexisting literature is that workers' decisions play no role in determining the equilibrium of the economy. In our model, policies that reduce the supply of workers in the informal labor market at given wages will increase the level of formality in the economy. This has noteworthy implications for the design of social programs in developing countries. We also show that an increase in the participation of secondary workers would tend to raise the level of informality in the economy. (JEL J24, J33)},

	abstract = {This study uncovers a gender labor productivity gap among informal ﬁrms in 14 developing economies. The mean labor productivity of women-owned informal ﬁrms is approximately 15.6 percent (0.17 log points) lower than that of men-owned informal ﬁrms. The difference in productivity is larger at the lower quantiles of the labor productivity distribution than at the higher quantiles. The Kitagawa-OaxacaBlinder and quantile decomposition methods are used to estimate the aggregate ‘‘endowment” vs ‘‘structural” effects, and individual factors’ contribution to the productivity gap. Several policy-relevant ﬁndings are revealed. First, the labor productivity gap at the mean is signiﬁcantly larger due to lower education, prior work experience, capitalization, and less protection from crime among women than men owners of informal ﬁrms. The smaller size of the women-owned ﬁrms and their higher return from operations under contracts narrow the mean productivity gap. Second, the productivity gap at the mean and different labor productivity quantiles can be substantially narrowed by providing more resources to women owners of informal ﬁrms, such as education, managerial experience, and physical capital, without improvements in their returns to women-owned informal businesses. Third, overall, there is evidence of ‘‘sticky ﬂoors” for women owners, but not ‘‘glass ceilings”. Fourth, there is heterogeneity in the contribution of individual factors to the productivity gap at different quantiles of the labor productivity distribution. Targeting policies to the relevant quantiles will improve their effectiveness. Fifth, there are important similarities and differences between groups of countries in low-income Africa, middleincome Africa, and Latin America, as far as the gender labor productivity gap and its drivers are concerned. Thus, an eclectic policy approach is needed, combining the broader ﬁndings of the literature with the prevailing local conditions. Last, the data do indicate that a majority of women- and men-owned informal businesses would like to formalize.},

Using a stated preference method allows calculation of WTP for benefits in this setting, despite the lack of data on worker transitions, and the fact that many workers are self-employed, which makes it difficult to use revealed preference methods. Workers highly value job stability: the average worker would be willing to forgo a 27 percent increase in income to obtain a one-year contract (relative to no contract), or to forgo a 12 percent increase to obtain thirty days of termination notice. There is substantial heterogeneity in WTP by type of employment and gender: women value shorter working hours more than men, while government workers place a higher value on contracts than do private-sector employees.},

We conducted a large survey among Brazilian formal workers to understand the extent and mechanics of this type of informality. We ﬁnd that payments under the table are widespread, sizeable, and proportionally larger for higher income workers. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that payments under the table generate a revenue lost from income tax of around 6.8\% of total revenues collected by the income tax. Arrangements involving these payments are typically suggested by the employer, with payments being typically made with cash or virtual payments, and are more widespread in industries with higher shares of informal workers. In addition, we study wage reporting dynamics around the ceiling of employee social security contributions, which can change the incentives for employees to underreport. We ﬁnd several patterns of earnings reporting that are consistent with employer and employees engaging in payments under the table. Finally, we incorporate novel data on labor lawsuits related to payments under the table to induce variation on the employer’s incentives to engage in underreporting.},

            We draw on household survey data from countries of all income levels and document that average unemployment rates increase with gross domestic product per capita. This is accounted for almost entirely by low—rather than high—educated workers. We interpret these facts in a model with frictional labour markets, a traditional self-employment sector, skill-biased productivity differences across countries, and unemployment benefits that become more generous with development. A calibrated version of the model does well in explaining the cross-country patterns that we document. Counterfactual exercises point to skill-biased productivity differences as the most important factor in explaining the cross-country unemployment patterns.},

This paper distinguishes different types of self-employment when studying this question. Using micro data for 77 countries from all income levels, we show that employers’ labor shares are increasing with GDP per capita, whereas own-account employment (self-employed without employees) is decreasing. We also find almost universally negative selection on education into own-account status relative to wage workers and positive selection into employers. To quantitatively match these facts, we introduce skill-biased technological change across countries in an occupational choice model with financial frictions. Our model predicts an average of 19\% output gains in low-income countries from removing financial frictions. In contrast, an alternative model with skill-neutral technological change cannot match the high own-account employment share in low-income countries, thus overestimating the output gains by 13 percentage points.},

First, one can make explicit assumptions about the structure of credit and insurance markets and identify the income process or the information set of the individuals. Second, one can assume that the income process or the amount of information that consumers have are known and test the implications of the theory. In general there is an identiﬁcation issue that has only recently being addressed with better data or better ‘‘experiments’’.

We argue that social protection policies provide incomplete and erratic protection against risks, do not redistribute enough and hurt productivity—in sum, that they are inconducive to socially inclusive growth. We propose a new social protection architecture based on the principle of universality with respect to the relevant population and discuss its implications for health; retirement pensions; protections against disability, death and the loss of employment; poverty; inequality; and for firm and worker behavior among various margins that impact productivity.

Policies oriented to reduce labor informality have a limited impact and are costly from the fiscal point of view, policies oriented to reduce business informality are more effective, but does not necessarily reduce labor informality if they are directed towards low productivity firms, because such firms do not have incentives to hire formally. The methodology used to illustrate these facts was the estimation of Ulyssea (2018) for the case of Colombia with the mentioned institutional constraints and a minimum wage. The data base used compiles most of the firm information available in the country (Fernández, 2021).},

Our model matches the main stylized facts on informality for developing countries and appears to be a good candidate for policy analysis. In this framework, we study the impact on informality, wages and unemployment of policies that may be used to reduce informality. We consider changes in product market regulation (PMR) and in two types of fiscal policies, labor taxes and formality enforcement. We find that lessening PMR decreases informality and unemployment simultaneously, indicating that there is not necessarily a tradeoff between informality and unemployment. The tradeoff appears when fiscal policies are used, though. Moreover, the impacts of PMR on unemployment and on wages are larger under collective than individual bargaining. With respect to wage inequality, lessening PMR reduces it, while lower taxes tend to increase the formal sector wage premium.},

	abstract = {This paper sheds light on the intricate relationship between employment protection and labor market dynamics. I study how firms and workers choose to supply and demand informal, temporary, and permanent jobs and how workers transition between them. I also investigate the consequences of employment protection, analyzing how severance pay upon firing, particularly concerning permanent contracts, affects the transitions of workers between jobs. To study these issues, I develop an equilibrium model with directed search, where firms and workers jointly determine the types of contracts available in the market. The model is estimated using the novel Peruvian Employer-Employee dataset. In equilibrium, workers climb a job ladder, where informal jobs represent the initial step towards formal employment, and temporary contracts serve as a stepping stone to permanent positions, the workers’ most desirable contracts. In the short run, reducing the severance pay from 6.0 to 1.2 monthly wages promotes total formal employment. Moreover, it generates a substitution of temporary jobs for permanent ones, improving the internal composition of formal labor. However, these gains decrease by more than 50\% in the long run when firms adjust the relative wages and contract offerings in response to the reduced severance pay. This difference between short and long-run effects highlights the crucial need to examine employment protection policies through the lens of an equilibrium model.},

            This article develops an analytical framework to study firm and exporter growth and provides a dynamic foundation for a standard general equilibrium trade model. Firm-level growth is the result of idiosyncratic productivity improvements with a continuous arrival of new potential producers. A firm enters a market if it is profitable to incur the marginal cost to reach the first consumer and pays an increasing marketing cost to reach additional consumers. I calibrate the model using data on the cross section of firm sales and bilateral trade, as well as the rate of incumbent firm exit. The calibrated model predicts that a firm’s growth is inversely related to its initial size, and that the distribution of growth rates of small firms is heavily skewed to the right. These predictions are confirmed by looking at the growth of sales of U.S. firms and Brazilian exporters to the United States. I use this model to study the impact of cross-firm reallocations on economic activity and measured productivity.},

            We develop and structurally estimate a model of heterogeneous multiproduct firms that can be used to decompose the firm-size distribution into the contributions of costs, “appeal” (quality or taste), markups, and product scope. Using Nielsen barcode data on prices and sales, we find that variation in firm appeal and product scope explains at least four fifths of the variation in firm sales. We show that the imperfect substitutability of products within firms, and the fact that larger firms supply more products than smaller firms, implies that standard productivity measures are highly dependent on implicit demand system assumptions and probably dramatically understate the relative productivity of the largest firms. Although most firms are well approximated by the monopolistic competition benchmark of constant markups, we find that the largest firms that account for most of aggregate sales depart substantially from this benchmark, and exhibit both variable markups and substantial cannibalization effects.},

            Performance pay for tax collectors has the potential to raise revenues, but might come at a cost if it increases the bargaining power of tax collectors vis-à-vis taxpayers. We report the first large-scale field experiment on these issues, where we experimentally allocated 482 property tax units in Punjab, Pakistan, into one of three performance pay schemes or a control. After two years, incentivized units had 9.4 log points higher revenue than controls, which translates to a 46\% higher growth rate. The scheme that rewarded purely on revenue did best, increasing revenue by 12.9 log points (64\% higher growth rate), with little penalty for customer satisfaction and assessment accuracy compared to the two other schemes that explicitly also rewarded these dimensions. The revenue gains accrue from a small number of properties becoming taxed at their true value, which is substantially more than they had been taxed at previously. The majority of properties in incentivized areas in fact pay no more taxes, but instead report higher bribes. The results are consistent with a collusive setting in which performance pay increases collectors’ bargaining power over taxpayers, who have to either pay higher bribes to avoid being reassessed or pay substantially higher taxes if collusion breaks down.},

            We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using 138 prominent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016 in the United States using a difference-in-differences approach. We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.},

            The fall of labor’s share of GDP in the United States and many other countries in recent decades is well documented but its causes remain uncertain. Existing empirical assessments typically rely on industry or macro data, obscuring heterogeneity among firms. In this article, we analyze micro panel data from the U.S. Economic Census since 1982 and document empirical patterns to assess a new interpretation of the fall in the labor share based on the rise of “superstar firms.” If globalization or technological changes push sales toward the most productive firms in each industry, product market concentration will rise as industries become increasingly dominated by superstar firms, which have high markups and a low labor share of value added. We empirically assess seven predictions of this hypothesis: (i) industry sales will increasingly concentrate in a small number of firms; (ii) industries where concentration rises most will have the largest declines in the labor share; (iii) the fall in the labor share will be driven largely by reallocation rather than a fall in the unweighted mean labor share across all firms; (iv) the between-firm reallocation component of the fall in the labor share will be greatest in the sectors with the largest increases in market concentration; (v) the industries that are becoming more concentrated will exhibit faster growth of productivity; (vi) the aggregate markup will rise more than the typical firm’s markup; and (vii) these patterns should be observed not only in U.S. firms but also internationally. We find support for all of these predictions.},

For identification, I leverage time-varying sector-by-area and across-areas changes in payroll tax rates in Argentina with difference-in-differences analyses. Four main findings emerge. First, changes in the payroll tax rate affect informality in the expected directions: tax cuts reduce the share of informal workers while tax hikes increase it, although effect sizes are modest. Second, the effects on informality vary significantly by firm size: payroll tax cuts reduce informality among wage earners only in large firms, which account for a small proportion of overall informality, while tax hikes shift employment toward small firms and increase their already higher share of informal workers. Third, the effects on informality are mainly driven by recently hired workers: tax cuts reduce reliance on newly hired workers, who are more likely to be informal, while tax hikes increase it, and informality is most affected among newly hired workers. Fourth, wages show little response to changes in payroll tax rates, both for formal and informal workers. Overall, these results provide new insights into the effects of payroll tax rate changes on labor markets with an informal sector, and highlight the importance of firm size and worker tenure in mediating the effects on informality.},

According to estimates derived from propensity score matching, MFS adoption decreases the informal sector size in a range of 2.4 – 4.3 percentage points of GDP. These formalization effects may stem from different possible transmission channels: improvement in credit access, increase in the productivity/profitability of informal firms attenuating subsistence constraints typical of entrepreneurship in the informal sector, as well as possible induced growth of firms already in the formal sector. The robustness of these results is supported by the use of an alternative estimation approach (instrumental variables).

	title = {Tax systems and inter-ﬁrm trade: {Evidence} from the {VAT} in {Brazil}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we document a number of new empirical patterns on the relationship between the tax
system and inter-firm trade using anonymized administrative data from the tax authority of the state of
São Paulo.1 The data include aggregated yearly flows between firms from electronic invoices. One of the
key advantages of the Brazilian electronic invoice data over other newly available datasets on firm-to-firm
transactions is that both VAT-registered and non-VAT firms must use electronic invoicing.2 As a result, the
data allow us to map the trade network of VAT-registered and non-VAT firms, including when firms switch
tax regimes. We exploit these data using a rich set of research designs, including a reform that changed the
location of the revenue-based VAT threshold within the period of analysis.
As a starting point, we show that some firms below the VAT threshold bunch at the threshold to avoid the
mandatory VAT registration, while other firms voluntarily register. This pattern is in line with Liu et al. (2017)
who study the VAT system in the UK. We use information from firms’ characteristics and firms’ network to
show systematic patterns in the choice of voluntary registration. For instance, firms that voluntarily register
have higher input shares from VAT-registered suppliers.
Next, we use variation from firms switching tax regime to show that there is a clear link between tax
regimes and trade networks beyond a pure selection story (e.g., firms characteristics such as sector of activity that could determine both registration and trade networks). We implement an event study exploiting firms
switching into the VAT and out of the VAT to show how the VAT intensity of their inputs changes. This
research design exploits the panel feature of our data, which allows us to control for fixed characteristics of
firms through fixed effects. Our main finding is that firms start trading relatively more with firms in their
new tax regime as soon as they switch regime.
There are three candidate explanations for this result. First, there could be time-variant omitted variables unrelated to a firm’s (potential) trade network driving both tax regime switches and changes in trade
patterns. The most obvious concern is that firms that switch into (resp. out of) VAT are growing more (resp.
less) in previous years than the average firm. Yet, we show that controlling for pre-trends in revenue and
input does not affect our results. Although this does not remove all potential sources of omitted variable
bias unrelated to a firm’s (potential) trade network, it indicates that such a bias does not necessarily drive
our results. In that case, there remains two explanations that imply causal links between tax regimes and
(potential) trade networks. Firms may change tax regime because they experience or expect changes in the
composition of their trade network. Firms may change the composition of their trade network because they
change tax regime. These findings suggest a causal link between tax regime and firm networks, in any one
of the two directions of causality.
Overall, our results are consistent with production distortions: we find (partial) segmentation in the network between VAT-registered and non-VAT firms, i.e., firms trade relatively more with firms in their own
tax regime. The degree of segmentation, however, is mitigated by the fact that firms are heavily dependent on key suppliers. In fact, most firms trade across tax regimes, and most firms have a VAT-registered
firm among their main trade partners (note: we are still deriving the quantitative implications of our findings). Moreover, these distortions should be weighted against other key motivations for exemptions such
as compliance costs that could be quite large for small firms below the threshold.
This paper contributes to the literature by shedding new light on how tax systems interact with taxpayers
sourcing decisions in the context of one of the main tax instruments in the world: the VAT. Although the

@article{nathalia_transicion_2023,
	title = {Transición verde y formalización laboral en {Colombia}},
	abstract = {Al igual que en el resto de los países de América Latina, la transición verde traerá grandes desafíos en Colombia, pero también la oportunidad de construir un nuevo modelo de desarrollo que sea más sostenible, inclusivo y que genere mayor valor agregado. Por un lado, este proceso involucrará la transformación del aparato productivo y, en particular, la renovación de varios sectores económicos para mitigar sus emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI). Por otro lado, la transición verde demandará la creación de nuevas prácticas en materia de adaptación para fortalecer la resiliencia del país ante eventos climáticos extremos. La aprobación de la Ley 2169 de 2021 en Colombia se une a una serie de esfuerzos del país para impulsar el progreso de la transición verde y hacer frente al cambio climático. Esta ley tiene como objetivo promover el desarrollo bajo en carbono del país mediante el establecimiento de metas y medidas mínimas en materia de carbono-neutralidad y resiliencia climática. Anticipar las futuras disrupciones en el mercado laboral como consecuencia de la transformación del aparato productivo a lo largo de la transición verde es clave para asegurar que dicha transición no solo sea sostenible sino también justa e inclusiva. El presente documento analiza los posibles efectos de la transición verde sobre la creación de empleo verde y formal en Colombia. A lo largo del análisis, se denominan sectores marrones a los diez sectores de la economía que generan más emisiones de GEI por unidad de valor agregado. Por el contrario, los sectores productivos con mayor potencial de contribuir a los objetivos de mitigación y adaptación se identifican como sectores potencialmente verdes. Por un lado, se espera que la estrategia de mitigación de las emisiones de GEI provoque una desaceleración del crecimiento del valor agregado en sectores marrones y, por lo tanto, de la generación de empleo en dichos sectores. Por otro lado, se espera que la implementación de la estrategia de mitigación y adaptación fortalezca el crecimiento de los sectores verdes emergentes y cree nuevos empleos verdes y formales. Los resultados del análisis sugieren que, en un escenario de Colombia en 2030 en el cual se cumple la meta nacional de mitigación de GEI, asumiendo que se mantiene una tasa anual de reducción de las emisiones de GEI en sectores marrones del 5\% con respecto al año base (2019), y asumiendo también que los sectores verdes contarán con un punto porcentual adicional en sus niveles de inversión, la creación neta acumulada de empleo verde y formal podría ser positiva en 2030. Estos resultados reafirman que la descarbonización de los sectores marrones debe estar acompañada de niveles de inversión adecuados en sectores potencialmente verdes, tanto pública como privada, tanto en capital humano como en físico, para mitigar las posibles disrupciones que la descarbonización generaría en el mercado laboral. La inversión en sectores potencialmente verdes, a su vez, podría contribuir a los esfuerzos por incrementar la formalización laboral en el país, teniendo en cuenta que los empleos verdes son, en general, más formales que en el resto de la economía. Finalmente, teniendo en cuenta la estructura actual de las competencias de los trabajadores informales y formales, este documento presenta algunas bases para el análisis de las competencias necesarias para acompañar la transición de trabajadores hacia empleos más verdes.},

This reduction is driven by women, who experience a 15\% decrease in the probability of transitioning from informal employment to inactivity. I also find that this reduction is concentrated among female secondary earners residing in households with dependents. These findings suggest that SP may operate through a novel channel, namely that health insurance enables caregivers to continue working by reducing health shocks among dependents.},

	abstract = {Although evidence of a productivity gap between formal and informal ﬁrms has been observed, this ‘‘formality premium” has been less explored for microﬁrms. The informality of microﬁrms is a central concern in low- and middle-income countries, leading to a crucial demand for designing economic policies addressing this issue. We ﬁll this void by estimating a productivity premium for the case of Colombia, considering two margins of formality for microﬁrms: extensive, referring to business registration, and intensive, which includes labor regulations. We use a unique longitudinal dataset from the Microenterprise Survey by the Colombian Statistics Department, which follows approximately 39,000 micro-establishments with up to nine employees during 2012–2016. We utilize the transition into and out of formality to estimate the productivity premium (yearly sales per worker) between informal and formal ﬁrms, thereby exploring differences concerning initial productivity. We use a ﬁxed-effects quantile regression to explore differential effects along the productivity distribution. We ﬁnd evidence of a premium for both the extensive (18\%) and intensive margins (7\%), a gap that decreases with a ﬁrm’s productivity when considering a strict deﬁnition of formality. The evidence of these premiums is related to two growth strategies of ﬁrms: an increase in capital investments for the extensive margin and an increase in human capital quality for the intensive margin. Further, we ﬁnd the premium is notably wider for young ﬁrms (less than three years in the business) relative to the older; and for the least productive ‘necessity’ driven businesses in comparison with the business-driven businesses. We do not ﬁnd systematic differences according to the gender of the owners. These results are new evidence to support the existence of a premium and the transition into and out of formality for microﬁrms in middle-income countries. Moreover, they suggest that microﬁrms’ formalization and growth policies should be oriented toward promoting and enhancing formality’s beneﬁts.},

The results estimated by fixed effects exhibit a positive and significant effect of the competition of companies with labor informality in the total innovation of formal companies. On the other hand, once the formalization and job creation policy was implemented, there was a decrease in total innovations of formal companies. The empirical analysis also highlights a different impact of informal competition depending on whether the innovation is in process or product. In particular, this research finds that process innovations are more intensely affected by labor informality than product innovations.

The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy, in particular to business cycle moments for employment and informality. We show that interest rate shocks, which affect speciﬁcally job creation in the formal sector, are key to obtain a countercyclical informality rate. In our model, the presence of an informal sector might help to mitigate the impact of a stringent labor regulation on employment and consumption ﬂuctuations. In that sense, it adds ﬂexibility to the economy in its adjustment to shocks, but at the cost of a lower productivity and an excess TFP and output volatility. Reducing the burden of labor regulation to the formal sector might achieve the goal of reducing output volatility while improving at the same time the efﬁciency in the allocation of resources.},

Yet, the associated efficiency cost is lower than it is in the United States, and it is lower in labor markets with higher informality within Brazil. This is because formal reemployment rates are lower to begin with where informality is higher, so that a larger share of workers would draw UI benefits absent any moral hazard.

	abstract = {We develop a search model of informal labor markets with worker and  rm heterogeneity, intra- rm bargaining with imperfect substitutability across types of workers, and a comprehensive set of labor regulations, including minimum wage. Stylized facts associated with the informal sector, such as smaller  rms and lower wages, emerge endogenously as  rms and workers decide whether to comply with regulations. Imperfect substitutability across types of workers, decreasing returns to scale, and convex vacancy-posting costs enable the model to reproduce empirical patterns incompatible with existing frameworks in the literature: the presence of skilled and unskilled workers in the formal and informal sectors, the rising share of skilled workers by  rm size, the declining formal wage premium by skill, and the rising  rm-size wage premium by skill. These features also allow us to analyze the equilibrium responses to changes in the demand and supply of di erent types of labor. We estimate the model using Brazilian data and show that it reproduces various margins of labor market changes observed between 2003 and 2012. The change in the composition of the labor force appears as the main driving force behind the reduction in informality. We illustrate the use of the model for policy analysis by assessing the e ectiveness of a progressive payroll tax in reducing informality.},

	abstract = {The high level of informality and the low level of savings observed in developing countries are fundamentally linked because informal workers have limited access to formal financial institutions. We study this link by developing and estimating a labor market model where workers can be employed both formally and informally and agents can save through both formal and informal financial institutions. We estimate the model on nationally representative data for Colombia and use the estimated model to simulate counterfactual experiments. Results show that reaching full financial inclusion of informal workers would increase savings by 3\% a month and formal assets by 21\%. The same policy would strongly decrease inequality in assets and mildly decrease inequality in consumption.},

The model is an extension of a search and matching model where firms and workers form jobs that can be both formal and informal. Contrary to previous works on Latin America focusing on the impact of the minimum wage on inequality, the policy implications drawn from the model focus on overall welfare. The main result is that introducing or increasing a mandatory minimum wage has an ambiguous impact on workers’ welfare. This ambiguity arises by taking into account not only the standard employment effects but also the equilibrium effects that change workers’ bargaining power with respect to firms. Interestingly, the bargaining power impact is present both when bargaining for formal jobs that follow minimum wage rules and for informal jobs that do not.},

To interpret this evidence, we build a general equilibrium model that features: 1) industry dynamics dictated by heterogeneous ﬁrms, 2) search and matching friction, and 3) imperfectly enforced legislation, leading to informal employment along the intensive and extensive margin. We estimate the model using ﬁrm and worker-level data from Peru — a country where more than 70 percent of the population is employed in informal jobs, and use the model as a laboratory to assess the distributional consequences of ﬁrm-level taxes and policies.},

Since the mid‐1990s, both inequality and volatility of earnings have declined significantly in Brazil's formal sector. Higher‐order moments of the distribution of earnings changes show cyclical movements in Brazil that are similar to those in developed countries like the US. Relative to the formal sector, the informal sector is associated with a significant earnings penalty and higher earnings volatility for identical workers. Earnings changes of workers who switch from formal to informal (from informal to formal) employment are relatively negative (positive) and large in magnitude, dispersed, negatively (positively) skewed, and less leptokurtic. Our results suggest that informal employment is an imperfect insurance mechanism.},

We conducted a large survey among Brazilian formal workers to understand the extent and mechanics of this type of informality. We ﬁnd that payments under the table are widespread, sizeable, and proportionally larger for higher income workers. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that payments under the table generate a revenue lost from income tax of around 6.8\% of total revenues collected by the income tax. Arrangements involving these payments are typically suggested by the employer, with payments being typically made with cash or virtual payments, and are more widespread in industries with higher shares of informal workers. In addition, we study wage reporting dynamics around the ceiling of employee social security contributions, which can change the incentives for employees to underreport. We ﬁnd several patterns of earnings reporting that are consistent with employer and employees engaging in payments under the table. Finally, we incorporate novel data on labor lawsuits related to payments under the table to induce variation on the employer’s incentives to engage in underreporting.},

It considers the extensive margin, where workers are hired by unregistered employers, and the intensive margin, where even though jobs are carried out by registered firms, employees are off the books. Peru’s relentless informal employment and its unprecedented trade-driven growth provides an ideal case study. Using a rich household survey, this study finds that exposure to trade impacts on informality through two competing and contrasting mechanisms. On the one hand, extensive-informal employment declines as unregistered employers shrink or exit due to their low productivity. On the other hand, intensive-informal employment rises as registered employers reduce costs by hiring informal workers. Furthermore, results suggest that the intensive margin drives the overall effect. Hence, trade liberalization increases informality.},

We divide workers into five work statuses: formal wage-employed, formal self-employed, upper-tier informal wageemployed, lower-tier informal wage-employed, and informal self-employed. We evaluate the patterns of the occupational turnover between these work statuses and assess their impact on wage dynamics. In all the countries, wages are highest for formal workers and lowest for lower-tier informal jobs. The proportion of formal workers who maintain their work status of origin or move up the job ladder is significantly higher than those who transition into lower-paying work statuses. However, despite the high labour turnover experienced by lower-tier informal wage employees, most failed to move up the wage ladder. Education plays an important role, as it increases the probability of transitioning into a better job and, within informality, the chance of better wages.},
